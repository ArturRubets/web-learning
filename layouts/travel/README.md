## Additional Information

In this project, I utilized the following technologies and tools:

Swiper: Swiper is a powerful and flexible JavaScript library for creating responsive and touch-enabled sliders and carousels. I used Swiper to implement the header section on the website, providing an interactive and visually appealing carousel of images and content.

Gulp: Gulp is a task runner that automates repetitive tasks in the web development workflow. I used Gulp to streamline the build process, such as compiling SCSS files into CSS, optimizing images, and minifying JavaScript files, to enhance the website's performance and loading speed.

Module Structure: I followed a modular approach in organizing the project's codebase. This means breaking down the code into smaller, reusable modules, allowing for better maintainability and scalability of the code. Each module focuses on specific functionalities and can be easily integrated into the main project structure.

Feel free to explore the Figma design and visit the website to see the implementation in action.
